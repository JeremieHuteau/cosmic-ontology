Ontology of cosmic objects.
===

This repo contains the work realized by a 3 man team during the Ontology class in Universit√© Paul Sabatier's graduate CS course.

# Developer's guide
An ontology description should contain:

 - a text document explaining in natural language the classes and their relations
 - a .owl document containing the ontology objects definitions
 - (optional) an image of the class and role hierarchies (to quickly get a global view)

We will most likely not implement any of this, but I think mentionning it (maybe in the "Further work" section) would be relevant and beneficial.

# Occurents

An occurrent, as I undestand it, is a process (something happening over time). Currently, we do not have any in our ontology.


A star has a life, which is a process. This life can have phases (proto-star, red-dwarf, black-hole (?)), which are linked to the life by a mereological relationship (the proto-star phase of the sun is part of the life of the sun).

(maybe not) A body which orbits something undergoes an "orbiting" process, in which it moves through space. This movement can be split into parts: I'm thinking about the perihelion and stuff like that (furthest point from the barycenter, closest, etc...) which are not real objects. Is it some kind of fiat boundary ? (there's the part where the body moves away from its barycenter, the part where it comes back)

# Quality

A star has a brightness, a body a mass, an orbit a speed (maybe angularo-relativisticly-dependent on its trajectory or something): it would be nice to have at least one. 

Is "brightness" a class, which can be instantiated by something (138 lumen isA/instanciates Brightness, star1 hasQuality 138 lumens) or a data property (star1 hasBrightness 138) ? (don't look too hard into these examples, I did not understand qualities/determinables)
